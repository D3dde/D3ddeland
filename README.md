## why

I created these dotfiles with the aim of making a minimal (I think) Unix porn-proof ( :D ) Hyprland configuration because I didn't like many other configs.

For these dotfiles, I used Pywal16, but with a little effort (and patience), it can be easily swapped with Wallust and Hellwal. I used Pywal16 because it works well for my system, but in the future, I might consider swapping it out.
